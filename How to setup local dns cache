This tutorial, describes the process to setup local DNS cache.

My environment: Centos 7.1, hosted on Azure

Steps:

  1)  Install Name Service Caching Daemon {NSCD}. NSCD, catches calling gethostbyname calls and few others.
        yum -y install nscd
  
  2)  Modify NSCD configuration, as per the needs. As per the use case, parameter values needs to be changed.
        
        Notes: If a large volume of requests is being made, threads has be tweaked, max-db-size is the max size of its on-disk 
        database files
  
  3) Once configured, start the service
        systemctl start nscd

  Note: In order to test NSCD, use getent hosts.

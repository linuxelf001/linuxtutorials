This tutorial is intended for audience, who wants to setup NFS server and to mount NFS share on NFS client.
For the purpose of this tutorial, I used linux servers hosted on Azure platform.

My setup:

      nfs server, centos 7.1
      nfs client, centos 7.1
 
Procedure:
      
      NFS server:
       
       1) Using the steps described in https://github.com/rginjupalli/linuxtutorials/blob/gh-pages/Setup%20virtual%20drive%20using%20mdadm
            I have created 2TB virtual drive on NFS server, for /data.
       
       2) Next, assign instance IP address to NFS server.
           Shutdown the server. Using Azure potal, go to server settings -> IP addresses -> Instance IP address on -> save
           
       3) Start the server and then run the script: 
            https://gist.github.com/rginjupalli/5b4d8cda0ed338dadbe6
            
          Note: Above script has been generated using REDHAT NFS application. 
          In the script, modify XX.XX.XX.XX with your client IP address and /data with your NFS server share.
      
       3) Running above script, does all the magic to setup NFS share and updating /etc/exports file with client information as well.
       
       4) As a sanity check, ensure these services are running on NFS server - nfs-server, rpcbind, nfs-config
          systemctl status nfs-server
          systemctl status rpcbind
          systemctl status nfs-config
       
      NFS client:
       
       1) Similar to NFS server, assign instance IP address to NFS client.
           Shutdown the server. Using Azure potal, go to server settings -> IP addresses -> Instance IP address on -> save
       
       2) Start the server and then run the script: 
           You can find the script details here: https://gist.github.com/rginjupalli/41ceff51736c5d1e28a7
       
          Note: As mentioned, please ensure to modify XX.XX.XX.XX with your nfs server IP address and replace local with
          your local nfs client mount point
          
       3) mount -a

This tutorial is intended for audience, who wants to setup NFS server and to mount NFS share on NFS client.
For the purpose of this tutorial, I used linux servers hosted on Azure platform

My setup:

      nfs server, centos 7.1
      nfs client, centos 7.1
      Assign a static IP address to each.

Procedure:
      
      NFS server:
       
       1) Using the steps described in https://github.com/rginjupalli/linuxtutorials/blob/gh-pages/Setup%20virtual%20drive%20using%20mdadm
            I have created 2TB virtual drive mounted on /data 
       
       2) Using the REDHAT tool, nfsserver script has been generated. You can find the script details here: https://gist.github.com/rginjupalli/5b4d8cda0ed338dadbe6
            As mentioned, please ensure to modify XX.XX.XX.XX with your client IP address and /data with your NFS share 
      
       3) Running above script, does all the magic to setip NFS share and updating /etc/exports file with client information as well
       
       4) As a sanity check, ensure these services are running on NFS server - nfs-server, rpcbind, nfs-config
          systemctl start nfs-server
          systemctl start rpcbind
          systemctl start nfs-config
       
      NFS client:
       
       1) Using the REDHAT tool, nfsclient script has been generated. You can find the script details here: https://gist.github.com/rginjupalli/41ceff51736c5d1e28a7
            As mentioned, please ensure to modify XX.XX.XX.XX with your server IP address and with your NFS share details
       2) systemctl start rpcbind
       
       3) In progress
